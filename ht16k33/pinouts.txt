===========================

The COLON is at ROW8 COM0 and the DOT is at ROW8 COM1.  There is nothing else
on ROW8.

Each individual digit, rendered in ASCII ART and with letters stolen from the
manufacturer's datasheet, looks like this::

                    * Digits each occupy two ROWs, always 4 apart.
      AAAAAAA   
    FH   J   KB     * Digits left to right are on ROW0(4) through ROW3(7).
    F H  J  K B 
    F  H J K  B     * Within each digit, segments are assigned to their COMs
      G1   G2         as follows:
    E  N M L  C 
    E N  M  L C           A  B  C  D  E  F  G1 G2 H  J  K  L  M  N
    EN   M   LC       COM 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  0  1  2  3  4  5  6
      DDDDDDD         ROW 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  4  4  4  4  4  4  4
